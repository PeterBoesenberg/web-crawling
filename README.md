# webcrawling
My learning around webcrawling

# how to use
Edit the file config.yml and enter your own Email-Data. Exchange 
<your-email> with e.g. "somebody@gmail.com"
<your-password> with your password, e.g. "supersecret"
(a good idea with gmail would be an app-password, see here: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en)

# what's in here
I use RSelenium to crawl webpages and separate my code with modules. In this case, there is only one module "mail".
